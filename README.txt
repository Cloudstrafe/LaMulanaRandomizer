La-Mulana Remake Randomizer v1!

Data to be randomized will be read in from files.

Things of note:
* Holy Grail, Hand Scanner, and reader.exe will be made available with no requirements (this allows warping)
* A specified number of Sacred Orbs will also be made available with no requirements (default 3, matching the non-randomized game)
* In order to prevent ankh jewel locks, 4 ankh jewels will be available with no requirements (matching the non-randomized game)
* A specified number of Sacred Orbs will also be made available with no requirements
* Medicine of the Mind will not be randomized - Yellow Medicine may be swapped with other things, but the wrong-color ones will remain as normal for now
* The ratio of weights to ammo to "permanent" items will be preserved for shops
* Coin chests will be added in a future release
* The untransformed Spring in the Sky shop will be ignored for randomizer v1 purposes, because of missability
* The MSX item slot is guaranteed to be an item, so that the shop can revert to its former state after the MSX is purchased. Pre-MSX, you'll be able to buy weights there as normal.
* Randomizer v1 logic excludes the possibility of purchasing a new non-shield subweapon at a shop, in order to prevent confusion with ammo

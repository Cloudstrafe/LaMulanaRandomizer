La-Mulana Remake Randomizer v1!

Data to be randomized will be read in from files.

Things of note:
* Holy Grail, Hand Scanner, and reader.exe will be made available with no requirements (this allows warping)
* A specified number of Sacred Orbs will also be made available with no requirements (default 3, matching the non-randomized game)
* In order to prevent ankh jewel locks, 4 ankh jewels will be available with no requirements (matching the non-randomized game)
* A specified number of Sacred Orbs will also be made available with no requirements
* Medicine of the Mind and mantras will not be randomized (yet)
* The ratio of weights & ammo to "permanent" items will be preserved for shops (although the ratio of weights to ammo will not)
* Secondary shops will mostly ignored (for now)
* Coin chests will be added in a future release
* The transformed Spring in the Sky shop will have two backup items and one random item
* The MSX2 item slot is guaranteed to be an item, so that the shop can revert to its former state after the MSX is purchased. Pre-MSX, you'll be able to buy weights there as normal. (Initially this may actually be ignored or left as MSX2)
